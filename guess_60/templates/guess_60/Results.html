    <p>Here were the numbers guessed:</p>

    <p>
        {% for e in sorted_guesses %}
            {{ e }},
        {% endfor %}
    </p>

    <p>
        60% of the average of these numbers is {{group.sixty_percent_avg}};
        the closest guess was {{ group.best_guess }}
    </p>

    <p>
        Your guess was {{ player.guess }}.
    </p>

    <p>
        {% if player.is_winner %}
            {% if group.num_winners > 1 %}
                Therefore you are one of the {{ group.num_winners }} winners
                who tied for the best guess.
            {% else %}
                Therefore, you win.
            {% endif %}
        {% else %}
            Therefore, you lost.
        {% endif %}
    Your payoff is {{ player.payoff }}.
