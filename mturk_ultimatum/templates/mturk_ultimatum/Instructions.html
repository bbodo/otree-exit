        <p>
            First, every player will be randomly paired with another player. In
            other words, you will have a counterpart, but you will not be told
            who it is.
            Your identity will also remain hidden from your counterpart.
        </p>

        <p>
            The two participants in a pair will have two different roles: the
            <strong>proposer</strong> and the <strong>responder</strong>.
            You will be assigned randomly to a role, and it will be displayed
            on the next page. The role assignment is persistent across all rounds.
        </p>

        <p>
            The two of you will together receive {{ Constants.endowment }} in each round. 
            The experiment is about how to divide this amount. In each round, 
            the proposer will make the responder a take-it-or-leave-it offer,
            which the responder can accept or reject.
            If the offer is rejected, both will
            receive {{ Constants.payoff_if_rejected }}. The game will be played
            for {{ Constants.num_rounds }} rounds.

        </p>

        <h4 class="panel-sub-heading">
            Proposer's role
        </h4>

        <p>
            The proposer has the following {{ Constants.offer_choices_count }}
            options on how to divide the {{ Constants.endowment }} between the
            two players.
        </p>

        <ol>
            {% for give, keep in Constants.keep_give_amounts %}

                <li>{{ give }} for the responder (the proposer keeps {{ keep }})</li>

            {% endfor %}
        </ol>

        <h4 class="panel-sub-heading">
            Responder's role
        </h4>

        <p>
            {% if not group.use_strategy_method %}
                In each round, the responder can either accept or reject the offer.
            {% else %}
                While the proposer makes the offer, the responder can select
                which {{ Constants.offer_choices_count }} offers stated above
                to accept or reject.
                After the proposer has made the offer, it will be either
                accepted or rejected according to the responder's choices.
            {% endif %}
        </p>

        <h4 class="panel-sub-heading">
            Results
        </h4>

        <p>
            {% if not group.use_strategy_method %}
                In the end, when both players have made their decision, a
                results page will be displayed.
                Here the offer will be displayed once more, and whether it was
                accepted or rejected.
            {% else %}
                A results page will be displayed once both players have made
                their decisions and those decisions have been implemented.
                Here, it will be shown whether the offer was accepted or
                rejected.
            {% endif %}
        </p>


        Furthermore, one of the following two payoffs will be displayed:
        <ul>
            <li>If the offer is accepted, the players will receive a payoff
                accordingly
            </li>
            <li>If the offer is rejected, both players will
                receive {{ Constants.payoff_if_rejected }}</li>
        </ul>
        <h4 class="panel-sub-heading">
                Payoff
        </h4>
        <p>
            For this study, every point is worth ${{session.config.real_world_currency_per_point}}, and each player
            will receive a payoff according to the amount of points they received, 
            plus a participation fee of {{session.config.participation_fee}}.
